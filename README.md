da Vinci Setup Joint Interface Board (dSIB)
===========================================

This repository contains files for the da Vinci Setup Joint Interface Board (dSIB) used with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). The primary function of this board is to serve as a connector interface between the VHDCI-68 and DB-9 connectors on the Quad Linear Amplifier (QLA) and the DL-156 pin connectors for up to four Setup Joints (e.g., for 3 PSMs and 1 ECM). Note that the board is designed to mate directly with the QLA, without requiring any cables.
